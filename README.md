## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I first started planning how I would build my app on Trello.
- The main goal was to deliver the Minimun Viable Product, and work on extra features if I had the time to do so.
- As the time-frame was only 2 days, I had to prioritise functionality over many extra features.
- When the MVP was achieved, I worked on using a public API on my project.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- HTML.
- CSS.
- Ruby.
- Sinatra.
- Rapid API integration.
- Heroku back end deployment.
- Responsive design.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Definitely upgrade the RapidAPI plan.
- Use Media Query to make the app fully responsive for smartphone users.
- Fix the cars image to make them all the same size, even when the car title is too big (it's pushing the image down).

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- Stick with the MVP at the beginning! I wanted to add lots of features, bur the truth is that I wouldn't be able to achieve all in only 2 days.
- After that, I decided to use a simple API to add an extra feature to my app.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Use a different API that allows users to search for races, scuderias, pilots, rankings...
- Add more animations and maybe sounds.
